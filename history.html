            <h1 class="info"> <div id="tab">There</div>&nbsp; is a debate whether the Pythagorean Theorem was discovered by one person, or by many peoples in the world. In addition, historians are sorry because they are unaware of the date of discovery as well. However, this theory is most well known being discovered by Pythagoras, a Greek mathematician and philosopher.<img src="images/pythagoras.jpg" style="width: 80%;"> This can be proven false because the Mesopotamian tablet Plimpton 322, written between 1790 and 1750 BC during the reign of Hammurabi the Great, contains many entries closely related to Pythagorean triples during Babylonian times. Bartel Leendert van der Waerden conjectured that Pythagorean triples were discovered algebraically by the Babylonians. Written between 2000 and 1786 BC, the Middle Kingdom Egyptian Berlin Papyrus 6619 includes a problem whose solution is the Pythagorean triple 6:8:10, but the problem does not mention a triangle. The mathematician Euclid was the first to prove the Pythagorean Theorem.
